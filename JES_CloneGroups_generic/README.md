Hi everyone

This JES solution was created to answer a specific customer query. They wanted to be able to replicate the groups an existing user had onto a new user. With Viya, 
this is not possible - you have to edit each group and add the user to it. In some case, a new user might need to be added to 80+ groups causing delays and 
frustration. This gives the user the option to enter the existing user's email address, the new user's email address and then just hit submit to run the cloning
process.

This was my first foray into JES so I fully expect plenty of you to have suggestions for improvements - that's great. Send them in!
